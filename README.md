# Brain-tumour

Supported Python version: python-3.7.4-amd64


Brain Tumor Image Segmentation
This project focuses on detecting and segmenting brain tumors from medical imaging using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system reads input images (such as MRI scans), processes them, and highlights potential tumor areas for analysis.

🧠 Objective
To implement a reliable and efficient solution for brain tumor detection using image segmentation techniques and provide visual outputs for analysis. This can assist medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV for image processing

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

Machine Learning / Thresholding techniques for segmentation
